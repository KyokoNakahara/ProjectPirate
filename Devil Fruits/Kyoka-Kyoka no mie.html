                        <p class="Introduction">Embers D. Mieko more commonly known as just Miko and by her epithet
                            “Devilish
                            Musician”, is a pirate and musician from West Blue and cook and first commander of the Heart
                            Pirates. She
                            is
                            one of the thirteen pirates who are referred to as the “Worst Generation”. Her singing is
                            well known among
                            pirates. She is the daughter of Red-Haired Shanks and was a musician in his crew, until he
                            left her while
                            she was still a child. She travels alongside the Heart Pirates and supporting Law to find
                            the One Piece,
                            while also researching about the Will of D.
                            <br><br>
                            Before joining the Heart Pirates, she travelled a while as a musician. Through a series of
                            unlucky events,
                            she tried to protect someone she shouldn’t and faced Sakazuki, who left the battlefield,
                            after Mieko was
                            unconscious and badly injured at her back. She has a large burn scar on her back since then.
                            <br><br>
                            It was Ace, who discovered her and brought her to Whitebeard, who let her rest and get
                            healed by Marco.
                            She
                            stayed with them for half a year, learned more about her Devil Fruit and more about the
                            pirate life.
                            During
                            that time, she also received her first bounty 30.000.000. She was the first and only
                            daughter to
                            Whitebeard,
                            as well as the little sister to everyone. Whitebeard, Ace, and Mieko agreed on leaving Miko
                            behind on the
                            next island, as it will be safer for her. They promised to meet again.
                            <br><br>
                            After helping the Straw-Hat Pirates on said island, they agreed on taking her with them to
                            the next
                            island.
                            She became good friends with everyone and especially with Nico Robin, who is like her “older
                            sister”. It’s
                            been some time, until they separate again and just a few months later, she protected Law and
                            Bepo and
                            that’s
                            how she ended up with the Heart Pirates
                            <br><br>
                            During the timeskip, her bounty increased from 130,000,000 to 300,000,000 and the name
                            “Devilish Musician”
                            became a name known in the new world, as she was able to easily take down Very Good and some
                            lower-ranking
                            marines.
                            <br><br>
                            She recieved her first bounty, as mentioned, as she was part of Whitebeards crew. The first
                            raise was as
                            the marine saw her in a battle with the straw hats and got to know her devil fruit. Her
                            bounty was
                            130,000,000. After the Events in the Summit War of Marineford and during the timeskip, her
                            bounty was
                            raised to 300,000,000. After the Dressrosa Arc, her bounty got another raise to 450,000,000.
                            Eventually,
                            her bounty would be raised to 1,540,000,000 for her role in taking down Big Mom of the Four
                            Emperors.
                            After the Marine told the world who she is, after the first incident that somebody saw her
                            Emperors-Haki,
                            her
                            bounty was raised to 2,270,000,000.
