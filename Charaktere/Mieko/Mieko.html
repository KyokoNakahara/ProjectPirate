              Embers D. Mieko more commonly known as just Miko and by her epithet “Devilish Musician”, is a pirate and
              musician from West Blue and cook and first commander of the Heart Pirates. She is one of the thirteen
              pirates who are referred to as the “Worst Generation”. Her singing is well known among pirates. She is the
              daughter of Red-Haired Shanks and was a musician in his crew, until he left her while she was still a
              child.
              She travels alongside the Heart Pirates and supporting Law to find the One Piece, while also researching
              about the Will of D.<br><br>
              Before joining the Heart Pirates, she travelled a while as a musician. Through a series of unlucky events,
              she tried to protect someone she shouldn’t and faced Sakazuki, who left the battlefield, after Mieko was
              unconscious and badly injured at her back. She has a large burn scar on her back since then.
              <br><br>
              It was Ace, who discovered her and brought her to Whitebeard, who let her rest and get healed by Marco.
              She
              stayed with them for half a year, learned more about her Devil Fruit and more about the pirate life.
              During
              that time, she also received her first bounty 30.000.000. She was the first and only daughter to
              Whitebeard,
              as well as the little sister to everyone. Whitebeard, Ace, and Mieko agreed on leaving Miko behind on the
              next island, as it will be safer for her. They promised to meet again.
              <br><br>
              After helping the Straw-Hat Pirates on said island, they agreed on taking her with them to the next
              island.
              She became good friends with everyone and especially with Nico Robin, who is like her “older sister”. It’s
              been some time, until they separate again and just a few months later, she protected Law and Bepo and
              that’s
              how she ended up with the Heart Pirates
              <br><br>
              During the timeskip, her bounty increased from 30,000,000 to 300,000,000 and the name “Devilish Musician”
              became a name known in the new world, as she was able to easily take down Very Good and some lower-ranking
              marines.
